- Find the venue, the date (usually between mi-March and mid-April), the
  duration (3 days? 4 days?)
- Find a team (at least 2 people to organize the thing). You may want to
  have one person just responsible to "ping" the others "what the status
  now? what the plan for the coming week?", just to avoid the organization
  gets frozen. But of course it depends on how good you are organized.k
- Define the max nb of attendees
- Define how you wil select the attendees (X first who register, guest list
  only, a list of core members who will select the others). Consider 30-40
  people.
- Ask for the Act instnce to setup the website.
- web site online 6 months before the event
- Define a budget
  - venue
  - catering
  - 1 social event (optional)
  - travel
  - hotel
  - bank fees (this is an intl event with payments in several currencies)
  Perl QA Hackathon is ~12-14 kâ‚¬. You may want to have an organization
  (non-profit association, ...) that have its own bank account and that
  is able to emit invoices for sponsors.
- Find sponsors
  - corporate
  - community
- It seems there a Perl QA Hackathon twitter account. Use it.

- In the last months, plan when you will buy what.
- Things like plastic glasses, plates, fork and knives... non perishable
  can be buy in advance (if one can store them) 

- On the website, most of the things happens in the wiki.
  The "static pages" will only carry the venue address, hotel, and other
  boring (:-)) things

- If you can book the hotel for everyone in the same place, it's nicer.
  You can book cancelable rooms as long as you don't exactly who's coming
  and how long will they stay.
  When things stabilize, you can cancel en rebook non-cancelable to have
  better price (be careful: the "distance" to the event can change the
  price (it's usaually cheaper if you book in advance)

- People prefer to eat on site for lunch as it's less interuptive, more
  casual ("I can eat when the interuption is convenient for me")
  So you will need a fridge

- Network : 30 hackers on a wifi, this needs to be planned. Size it
  accordingly. With smartphone, and so, maybe you should be able to
  handle 1.5 to 2 devices per hacker.

- You need to have 1 or 2 people to refill the food and beverage depending
  on what people eat, drink, and want to eat/drink.

- Ask for special diet on the website/wiki. This helps to plan
  the social event in a place where evryone can enjoy the meal.
  (Avoid seefood only restaurant, meat only restaurant... yes this is
  just a nightmare!!!!)

- Follow your exepnses and your income (remind sponsors when they haven't
  paid yet)

- You'll have 30 persons in a room... will the room be cool or too hot or
  too cold?

- You'll need electricity for everyone.

- Is the access to the venue restricted? If so, who will be allowed to open
  to people?
  Are the toilets in the restricted area? Is there a smoking area in the 
  restricted area?

- When can you arive in the morning? When do you have to leave in the evening?
  Inform people they need to leave 30 min in advance.

- Code of Conduct: it's fashion. But we mostly know each others in those
  PQAH. Rmind people to be nice to each other.
  If you need more, either you select the wrong attendees or the community
  dosen't need this kind of event anymore.

- If you book a place (restaurant..) for the social event, be sure you have 
  written confirmation.
  and maybe re-check it's still OK one or 2 days.
